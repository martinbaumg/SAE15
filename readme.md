# UHA WiFi project

## Synopsis
The Wi-Fi UHA project consists of analyzing data relating to the recording of the strength of the Wi-Fi signal generated by the access points in Building C.

## Data
The data obtained from the Fipy Pycomm and was saved in the *data/raw* folder. It contains two files, one relating to a series of measurements taken on the ground floor of building C, the other to a series of measurements on the first floor of building C.

## Tasks
The tasks requested in this project are as follows.

1. Complete the src/data/extract-data.py program to format the datasets in a csv file.
2. Write a program that merges two csv files.
3. Establish for each variable the number of missing and outlying values ​​as well as the percentage that this represents.
4. Establish the number and percentage of observations that have outliers and/or missing values.
5. Define the ComputeMean and ComputeMedian functions (*src/model/model.py*) and calculate the mean and median of the Wi-Fi signal strength of the UHA network at each location where the measurements were taken.
6. Display the heatmap of the Wi-Fi signal strength of the UHA network according to the positions where the measurements were made.
